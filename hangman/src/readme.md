components needed 

psuedocode
new game 
random word is picked from the stored list of words (function component)
the rand dom word is then split into letters (.slice or .splice)
the length of that word is put on the screen in dashes .item.length
there is a list of options as in alphabet that the user can use as input 
when user clicks a letter - event listener & handler 
the value of that click is compared to the elements of the array of random word 
if the letter is in the array of letters in the  randomword then it pops up on the screen 
either that or it says wrong guess 
if all the items in this array is properly guessed then display 'you won'
if the wrong guesses = length of the array of the random word end game and say ''you lost '
the number of wrong guesses is stored
